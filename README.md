## ⚛️ Why Gatsby?
Gatsby is an "open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps". The Gatsby platform provides a number of benefits that [Pura](https://github.com/trendyminds/pura) is unable to offer:

- [Critical CSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/understanding-critical-css/) is automatically generated for you
- [CSS Modules](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/css-modules/) are available out-of-the box. This allows your CSS to be automatically scoped for your components
- [Sophisticated code splitting](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-code-splitting-works/) Not using a particular component or JS library on a page? Gatsby will only deliver the CSS and JS you're using
- Your site has [PWA support](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/progressive-web-app/) without any complex configurations
- A built-in templating language in React. Because Gatsby uses React you have the ability to use a templating system without reaching for something like Twig, Pug, HAML or another library.

## 📦 Deploying
To deploy your site, simply run `gatsby build` and deploy the `public/` folder to your web server.

## ✅ Tasks
